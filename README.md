# FraudTransaction-Detection
Fraud Transaction detection models for VESTA Corop Kaggle challenge in PySpark.
Compared  Logistic Regression (With different Regularization, ElasticNet, Iteration for Paramgrid)
Decsision Tree (Max Depth, Max Bucket Node parameters in Paramgrid)
Gradient Boosted Tree (Max Depth, Max Bucket Node parameters in Paramgrid)

Evaluated the models based on Precision-Recall curve area, ROC curve area, recall metrics.
